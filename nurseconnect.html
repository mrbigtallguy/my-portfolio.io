                <h2>USER RESEARCH</h2>
                <p>
                    Two methods were used to gather insights:
                    </p><p>
                        </p><p><b>Nurse Workshop</b><br>Nine Australian VAD Nurses were involved in a workshop with our unit coordinators. The transcripts were used by us to identify recurring needs and problems.</p>
                        <p><b>Secondary Research</b><br>Research into other high stress and emotionally-fatiguing occupations as well as current consumer and experimental stress-relief products.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>An affinity diagram was necessary to condense the hundreds of pages of transcripts into data we could use in ideation. The three key insights we discovered were: <br>
                        <b>The Double-Edged Sword</b><br>VAD nurses' intense capacity for empathy is both a blessing and a curse.<br>
                        <b>Required Respite</b><br> VAD nurses require regular respite, balanced between providing the optimum patient relationship and maintaining their own personal well being.<br>
                        <b>The Switch</b><br> As the VAD nurses become more stressed it becomes harder for them to turn off the switch, meaning they get less required respite.</p>
                <p></p>

                <h2>FIRST ROUND OF IDEATION</h2>
                <p>
                    The aforementioned insights formed the core of our ideation phases. We used IDEO's quirky, yet effective <a class="inline" href="https://www.ideou.com/pages/ideation-method-mash-up">Mash-Up</a> technique as well as a brainstorming to come up with several concepts quite quickly.<br> Our first concepts aimed to tackle the problem of compassion fatigue directly; stress-relief through physical solutions in spatial formats and wearable technology. Getting our heads around designing to solve a purely emotional need proved to be difficult initially, with the first concepts being relatively impractical and too broad in scope. We needed to ideate further and drill down into our research.

                <h2>SECOND ROUND OF IDEATION</h2>
                <p>
                    <br>We started with the concept of a digital platform which would help facilitate communication between Nurses, uutilising the strength of their cohort to help with providing respite. We distilled the following needs for VAD Nurses from a digital platform:<br>
                    <b>Subtlety, Frequency and Communication</b> <br> This resulted in the idea of a Check-In system which records VAD nurse emotions through facial-scanning when they start and finish their shifts, with the data being relayed to their Coordinator. A crucial aspect was the addition of an industry events and news page, as communication between fellow VAD nurses was found to be incredibly important in maintaining emotional resilience.<br> We gathered feedback on this from the Head VAD Nurse at the Prince Charles Hospital and shifted the emotional tracking idea to a desktop interface as the office is where VAD Nurses spend a lot of their time.

                <h2>PROTOTYPING</h2>
                <p>
                    The change from a Check-In touchpoint to a desktop application was highly beneficial. It allowed us to add more features and have a greater influence on the VAD nurse through more regular emotional scanning and more integration into their routine, catering to the needs of subtlety and frequency.<br> We drew up many wireframes for the Nurse and Coordinator interfaces, aiming to keep the information on screen easily digestable for the nurses as their main source of information through the day, as well as being easily glanceable for the coordinator who will check on their nurses when they feel necessary through their separate interface.<br> I dictated the design of the UI for Mik and I to work on in Sketch and the online prototyping tool InVision was used to make our Sketch mockups interactive. To finalise our prototype for presentation to the VAD Nurses, a concept video was created using After Effects and Premiere Pro.
