                <p>
                    We used four methods to gather insights from our users:

                        </p><p><b>Co-Creation Session</b><br>Listening session and semi-structured interviews with two members of Woolworths’ Format Development team and three senior designers from Wunderman Bienalto.</p>

                <h2>IDEATION</h2>
                <p>
                    Using an affinity diagram and brainstorming, we combined our key research findings and discovered three overarching needs for both customers and staff members which ensured a quality service experience: <br>
                    </p><p><b>Clarity, Reliability and Functionality.</b></p>
                    We created three personas, as well as storyboards and a customer journey map to represent and visualise our research on a personal level.
                    <br>With these in mind, we proceeded to the ideation phase. We chose IDEO’s ‘Mash-Up’ method which resulted in an eclectic range of concepts and took the one with the most practical potential for our stakeholders resulting in three final concepts. The self-service Service Desk UI concept provided the most significant customer service experience improvement and was also the easiest to scale across a wealth of different store formats, so we took this into the prototyping stage.

                <h2>PROTOTYPING</h2>
                <p>

                    Using InVision and Sketch, three separate UI prototypes were created: An A and a B customer interface and a staff interface. My role was to lead the UI design with Mik, as well as creating the ‘A’ interface (Mik created the staff interface and Declan created the B interface). Through roleplay, Mik, Sam and I created a video demonstrating the User Experience. As well as this, I created a few in-situ visualisations using Photoshop with Lucas’s Rhino 3D models.</p>
                <p>The UI design process was centred around creating a perception of progress for the user, who would normally spend their time waiting impatiently for a staff member to arrive. As it is a form-based interface, the on-screen information would need to be easily digested each step of the way to ensure a positive user experience and especially a positive post-purchase reaction; a perception from the user that they did not waste any time and their needs were satisfied.

                <h2>USER TESTING</h2>
                <p>
                    The prototypes were tested with four customers and three staff members using the Wizard of Oz technique as well as A/B Testing to test ease of use in both landscape and portrait interfaces. Both prototypes were designed with specific interactions in mind. Users were asked to complete the return of an item, call for general assistance, and purchase a packet of cigarettes. Staff members were tasked with completing a cigarette transaction as well as a product replacement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our user feedback came from a variety of ages and technological ability and was positive overall, with particular attention being drawn to the navigation of the interface.

                    <p></p>
                    <p>
                        </p><h3>"It'll take the hassle of explaining the problem out of the equation."</h3>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>
                        </p><h3>"Being able to change the language on the start page is a great feature."</h3>
                    <p></p>

                <p>
                    Some of the limitations of the final Service Desk UI prototype lie within the vast amount of services Woolworths offer. It was not possible to prototype every single interaction, so we focused on a the most common interactions at the service desk from our research. However, being a digital interface means that services can be added or modified easily, reflecting the fast pace of Woolworths’ environment.
